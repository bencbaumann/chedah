<h1>Starting the app locally</h1>

<p>Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:<p>

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
```

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
